#### Introduction
Today's one of the frequent international headline is industry and data centre Carbon and energy issue. Which leads the govenments, non-profiable organizations and corporate companies to conduct studies to analyze carbon footprint on regular basis to measure the impact of activities on global warming isues to create further action plans toreduce carbon emissions.

As we all know, "Data is the new oil" data centers account for at least 2 percent of all electricity use in the United States of America. Per U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report, data centers in USA consumed almost 61 billion Kilowatt-hours of electrical power in 2006. Also, EPA mandate government agencies to develop plans and strategies. strategies for energy efficient data centers for Govenments with a target of 20% energy efficiency improvement by 2011.

### Google Cloud
Today's top cloud providers like Amazon web services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for approximately 2/3 of all rentable computing service. Out of these three big data Centre holders, Google has the smallest share, but most decorbonize its data. In the year 2007, Google announced that it has achieved almost 100% renewable energy across all of its data center operations and it's Google claims that most of the data processed by Google Cloud has almost zero carbon emissions.

### Microsoft Azure
One of Microsoft's vision and goal is to make the data center disappear by avoiding and eliminating any environmental impact of its server clusters and farms. Microsoft consciously in working on carbon neutral since the year 2012 and 100 percent run on renewable energy since 2014.Right now, 60% of Microsfofts electric utilization are renewable and it has plans to improve it to 70% by the end of year 2023.
